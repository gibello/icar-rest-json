ICAr REST/JSON framework
========================

License: BSD (post-1999), means "as close as possible to public domain".

Features:
- Servlet-based REST framework
- JSON push parser (SAX-like).

Each feature is standalone and may be used independently, is designed in a minimalistic way
(as little code as possible), and has no external dependency (except a JRE, and servlets for REST).

The code may be cloned and embedded in your own code base, then modified to fit youy needs.

The ICAr REST framework was developed in 2011 for the needs of the CADES project
(a software suite for design and optimization of physical systems), on behalf of EBM Websourcing company.
It was financed by public funding from a french research project (ANR Siminthec).
